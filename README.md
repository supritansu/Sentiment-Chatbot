# Sentiment-Chatbot
Using the power of pretrained models from HuggingFace and OpenAI, we can make a powerful Chatbot equipped with all the necessary models to be able to help a user with Twitter as well as Amazon.

We have used webscraping tools to scrape twitter data using particular keywords and done sentiment analysis using 3 different techniques-bidirectional lstms,fine tuning Bert and fine tuning openai models. The details are in the twitter analysis file.
